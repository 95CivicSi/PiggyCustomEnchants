## FAQ
**Q:** How do I create/use an enchanted book? </br>
**A:** If you want to create an enchanted book, use the /ce enchant command on a normal book. Afterwards, you place the item you want to enchant on top of the enchanted book. It will then enchant your item.

**Q:** `ErrorException: "Invalid argument supplied for foreach()" (EXCEPTION) in "plugins/PiggyCustomEnchants.phar/src/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/PiggyCustomEnchants" at line 54` </br>
**A:** This is due to an outdated configuration from Version 1.0.0. You should delete your old configuration to allow PiggyCE to re-generate a new configuration.
